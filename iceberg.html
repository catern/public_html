<h1>PL iceberg</h1>
Inspired by <a href="https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/">the Cursed Computer Iceberg</a>,
I'm starting an iceberg of "cursed" PL facts.
<p>
Email me ice (facts) to contribute! Or suggestions on what to link to, for the facts I have below!
<p>
Here's what I have so far (vaguely in order of increasing obscurity):
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Lambda calculus is just a helpful syntax for writing proofs</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/parallelism-is-not-concurrency/">Parallelism is not concurrency</a>
<li>Moore's law has been dying and parallel programming has been the future since 1983:
  "<a href="https://sci-hub.do/10.1016/s0065-2458(08)60131-x">Lately, however, interest in functional programming has been greatly broadened by two promises that it holds out. First, because functional languages are extremely simple, and functional programs are free of side effects, it is easier to verify functional programs than procedural ones. Second, functional programming may make possible the automatic decomposition of a computation to run in parallel over multiple processors.</a>"
<li><a href="https://codon.com/compilers-for-free">Partial evaluation gives you compilers for free</a>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/dynamic-variables/">Exception handlers are just dynamically scoped continuations</a>
<li><a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monadic-shell.html">All IO is monadic</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/">Dynamic languages are static languages</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/">Logic, programs, and category theory are the computational trinity</a>
<li><a href="./inheritance.html">Inheritance was invented to support intrusive lists and simplify GC implementation relative to composition</a>
<li>call/cc is the computational interpretation of the law of excluded middle.
<li><a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/ZFS/context-OS.pdf">Fork is the law of excluded middle, and all continuations are delimited</a>
<li>Some surprising interpretation of coinduction/codata?
<li>Some surprising interpretation of effect systems/effect polymorphism?
<li>Some surprising interpretation of modal types?
<li>Some surprising interpretation of substructural type systems?
<li>Network packets/encryption are just values of an extensible type
<li><a href="http://tunes.org/wiki/microkernel.html">Microkernels are an abstraction inversion</a>
<li><a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/goldberg/pubs/gg92.pdf">You can do GC without tags</a>
<li><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.439.1202&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Tracing GC and refcounting are the same thing</a>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04738.pdf">You can make a compacting memory allocator without moving pointers.</a>
<li><a href="https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/papers/cdle.pdf">Primitive datatypes (e.g. product and sum types) are actually highly sophisticated universe-polymorphic type theory constructs</a>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2302111_Type-Directed_Partial_Evaluation">You can pretty print functions without their source code.</a>
<li><a href="http://math.andrej.com/2006/03/27/sometimes-all-functions-are-continuous/">All computable functions are continuous</a>
<li><a href="http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/">Function equality is decidable (at some types)</a>
</ul>
