<h1>PL iceberg</h1>
Inspired by <a href="https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/">the Cursed Computer Iceberg</a>,
I'm starting an iceberg of "cursed" PL facts.
<p>
Email me ice (facts) to contribute! Or suggestions on what to link to, for the facts I have below!
<p>
Here's what I have so far (vaguely in order of increasing obscurity):
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Lambda calculus is just a helpful syntax for writing proofs</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/parallelism-is-not-concurrency/">Parallelism is not concurrency</a>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer#Background">People have been saying "Single-core scaling/Moore's law is over, the future is parallel programming" since at least the 1980s.</a>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/359576.359579">Functional programming has been the future since at least 1978.</a>
<li>Something about quines?
<li>C's <code>void</code> should be called <code>unit</code>,
  but at least they kept the same syntax for applying <code>f</code> to <code>void</code>/<code>unit</code>: <code>f()</code>
<li><a href="https://codon.com/compilers-for-free">Partial evaluation gives you compilers for free</a>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/dynamic-variables/">Exception handlers are just dynamically scoped continuations</a>
<li><a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monadic-shell.html">All IO is monadic</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/">Dynamic languages are static languages</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/">Logic, programs, and category theory are the computational trinity</a>
<li><a href="./inheritance.html">Inheritance was invented to support intrusive lists and simplify GC implementation relative to composition</a>
<li>call/cc is the computational interpretation of the law of excluded middle.
<li><a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/ZFS/context-OS.pdf">Fork is the law of excluded middle, and all continuations are delimited</a>
<li><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00816703">Typeclass resolution is proof search</a> <!-- ultimately got this from http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/types.html#sessions -->

<li>Some surprising interpretation of coinduction/codata?
<li>Some surprising interpretation of effect systems/effect polymorphism?
<li>Some surprising interpretation of modal types?
<li>Some surprising interpretation of substructural type systems?
<li>Network packets/encryption are just values of an extensible type
<li><a href="http://tunes.org/wiki/microkernel.html">Microkernels are an abstraction inversion</a>
<li><a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/goldberg/pubs/gg92.pdf">You can do GC without tags</a>
<li><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.439.1202&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Tracing GC and refcounting are the same thing</a>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04738.pdf">You can make a compacting memory allocator without moving pointers.</a>
<li><a href="https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/papers/cdle.pdf">Primitive datatypes (e.g. product and sum types) are actually highly sophisticated universe-polymorphic type theory constructs</a>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2302111_Type-Directed_Partial_Evaluation">You can pretty print functions without their source code.</a>
<li><a href="http://math.andrej.com/2006/03/27/sometimes-all-functions-are-continuous/">All computable functions are continuous</a>
<li><a href="http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/">Function equality is decidable (at some types)</a>
</ul>
