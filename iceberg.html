<h1>PL iceberg</h1>
Inspired by <a href="https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/">the Cursed Computer Iceberg</a>,
I'm starting an iceberg of "cursed" programming language theory facts.
It's kind of like a list of PL <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/home.html">viewquakes</a>.
<p>
Email me ice (facts) to contribute! Or suggestions on what to link to, for the facts I have below!
<p>
Here's what I have so far (vaguely in order of increasing obscurity):
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Lambda calculus is just a helpful syntax for writing proofs</a>
<li><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/parallelism-is-not-concurrency/">Parallelism is not concurrency</a>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transputer#Background">People have been saying "Single-core scaling/Moore's law is over, the future is parallel programming" since at least the 1980s.</a>
  <!-- despite the failure of the transputer, many programmers are actually writing highly-parallel programs: on GPUs -->
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/359576.359579">Functional programming has been the future since at least 1978.</a>

<li><a href="https://www.seltzer.com/margo/teaching/CS508-generic/papers-a1/roghanchi17.pdf">Message passing is faster than shared memory</a>
<li>a â‰¤ b means "a implies b"
<li>Something about quines?
<li>C's <code>void</code> should be called <code>unit</code>,
  but at least they kept the same syntax for applying <code>f</code> to <code>unit</code>: <code>f()</code>
