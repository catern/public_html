I'm also on OFTC as "catern".

<h2>Making it easier to run distributed software</h2>
Distributed software, which accesses and depends on remote resources,
is harder to run than local-only software.
I'm interested in making it easier to run distributed software
for both programmers and end-users.
I think this will promote the development and use of open source distributed software,
which will in turn lead to more high-quality distributed software being available.

<h2>Taking lambda-abstraction as far as it can go</h2>
I'm interested in doing practical programming with just lambda-abstraction and application.
Many features,
both at the level of surface syntax (such as pattern matching, DSLs)
and type system (such as effect systems, access controls, DSLs)
are easily implementable with just lambda-abstraction and application,
and this allows them to be used productively in languages without such advanced features built-in.
I'm interested in taking this further, because I think this helps make such innovations more widely usable.

<h2>Improving Linux</h2>
Linux is the world's largest software project and the world's most successful open source project,
so it will probably be a foundation for my work for many years.
So, naturally, I'm interested in improvements to Linux.
