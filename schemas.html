<h1>Write (module) signatures, not (protocol) schemas</h1>
If you write a library, you'll have simpler code than if you write a standalone server,
because
type signatures (which describe libraries, modules and other importable pieces of code)
are substantially more expressive than protocol schemas
(which describe protocols for communicating with servers).
<p>
For example,
a function pointer is a valid argument or return type for a function in most languages, even in C.
But almost no protocol schemas support this.
In more advanced languages,
objects, interfaces, abstract data types, types themselves, type constructors,
references to other modules, and many other constructs
are valid arguments and return types.
You can't express any of that in protocol schemas;
this makes many tasks more complicated.
<p>
So why do people ever write servers instead of libraries?
<p>
A library can do anything that a standalone server can do.
But our modern Unix-derived programming environments are slanted towards standalone servers,
so some things are easier with standalone servers;
hence, servers are almost always the first choice.
<p>
Nevertheless, contrary to popular belief, libraries can do anything, including:
<ul>
  <li>Maintain stable, backwards-compatible interfaces
    <p>
    The precise details of how to maintain a backwards-compatible signature is language-specific,
    but it's possible in most languages.
    For example, don't add a new mandatory argument to an existing function;
    instead, add an optional argument with a default.
    <p>
    In fact, a library is strictly more powerful than a protocol schema in this regard:
    If you really wanted to,
    you could use a protocol schema directly to define the format of the data passed in and out of the library.
  <li>Be updated without restarting the process using them.
    <p>
    This field of techniques is called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_software_updating">dynamic software updating</a>.
    These techniques are actually quite easy
    if the library only does things that one could do over a protocol schema.
    If the library uses more than that bare minimum of features,
    dynamic software updating becomes harder, but still possible.
    <p>
    One interesting use of this ability is to implement
    extremely high-performance, but backwards-incompatible,
    <a href="http://catern.com/mobilelibs.html">wire protocols</a>.
  <li>Be used from, or implemented by, programs written in multiple languages
    <p>
    The most common way to support cross-language interaction in libraries is to go through the C type system;
    C functions can be called from, or implemented in, any language with a C FFI.
    Going through the C type system can be constraining,
    so
    <a href="https://github.com/tweag/inline-java">there</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/tweag/HaskellR">are</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3">many</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx">projects</a>
    which allow one language to call functions in another language without going through C.
    This also allows a signature in one language
    to have multiple implementations in other languages.
    <!-- 
it's important to note that the fundamental difficulty here isn't converting calling conventions,
or figuring out how to read datastructures in one language from another,
or things like that.

those things are difficult, true, but they aren't fundamental;
the fundamental difficulty is converting between the type systems of the two languages.
there's no equivalent of a char* in most languages - it's something that's simply not expressible;
so you need some kind of conversion from the interface in the using-language,
and the interface in the implementing-language.

For libraries/signatures,
this conversion is most commonly hand-coded in the using-language.
(Sometimes it's in a separate DSL, but we won't consider that here)
The using-language is usually able to call into 
some auto-generated using-language version of the implementing-language interface,
but such calls require special manipulations and special types;
to create a real using-language interface, then, an adapter is hand-coded.

Sometimes, the conversion is expressed with a separate DSL,
either annotations on the implementing-language interface,
or a model of the implementing-language interface in a separate DSL.
This allows the generated using-language signature to be higher-quality.
It's kind of like having a schema in the middle.

Writing the conversion completely in the implementing-language is rare, for unclear reasons.
The JNI takes the approach of writing the conversion in the implementing-language;
the using-language signature is fixed, and an auto-generated implementing-language signature is created from it,
which needs to be adapted to the idioms of the implementing-language.

Compare this to the situation with schemas.
The schema is an extra layer between the using-language and the implementing-language.
From the schema, a client (with a signature) is generated in the using-language,
and a server-stub (with a signature) is generated in the implementing-language.
These signatures are often pretty high-quality, when compared to the situation with libraries;
but they still usually need hand-coded adapter code,
which is often diffused throughout the program rather than centralized.
Note also that there's no way to write the "adaptor" in the schema language itself.

Compare also to the situation with custom network protocols that aren't described by a schema.
there, you might try to model the network protocol with some helper library,
but ultimately you probably will have to do a great deal of work by hand
in both the using-language and implementing-language.

So, a schema generates better using-language and implementing-language signatures,
compared to generating the using-language signature from the implementing-language signature,
or generating the implementing-language signature from the using-language signature.
Why?

The obvious answer is that schemas are greatly constrained relative to signatures,
so translating the schema into a signature stays in a well-understood, simple part of the signature language.

But then, why doesn't generating one signature from another signature work well,
if they're both in the simple subset?

Well... that's just complex.

So I feel like, if we could just enhance C to make a standard thing...
but no, it's not C that's the problem...

I mean, going from HLL1 to HLL2 should be good! Why isn't it?
It's just that a pivot language makes it easier to implement lots.
But we can still implement individual pairs.

also, my idea of generating the config-code, the CLI-arg-parsing stuff...
oh, whether we generate from Python signatures to Java/C++,
or generating from Java/C++ signatures to Python,
it's just shifting where the adaptor code lives,
and we'd prefer to write the adaptor code in Python...

  -->
 <!-- 
A higher level language to a lower level one...

I mean, there *is* no signature at the CLI level. That's the problem.

Suppose we had one; what would we want to do?

Well, so... We could generate a typed Python wrapper for it. And that... Would be good actually. It's appealing.

But, wait... The signature at the CLI level can't have full exposure to what all these types actually are.

Hmmmmmm. Like, what I'm saying is that if we have just some tagged path passed as an arg,
We don't actually know where that path comes from.

The path isn't guaranteed to be constructed correctly, because it has a public constructor. Not like in Python...

So that seems like a reason to generate down...

And that would be a matter of making a signature that has a path argument, which is only usable by us validly... If we call it, we'll be correct...

Seems not totally sound...

  <li>Run in parallel, using multiple cores.
    <p>
    Obviously: You can run library functions on multiple threads.
    Different threads can even have different IO and CPU priority levels.
  <li>Be built separately from the rest of the program, and have different dependencies.
    <p>
      For example,
      by <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297276/what-is-a-shaded-java-dependency">"shading" dependencies</a> in Java,
      or with linker scripts, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html">dlmopen</a>
      or <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd">DT_FILTER</a> in C.
    <p>
  <li>Isolate failures.
    <p>
      "<a href="https://cs155.stanford.edu/papers/sfi.pdf">Software fault isolation</a>"
      is all about this;
      SFI allows a library to be run in the same address space
      without the ability to interfere with other memory in that address space.
      Other techniques in this vein are used all the time for emulation and virtualization.
    <p>
  <li>Access resources on other hosts and in other environments.
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>In general, there's no reason a library can't spin up a stub in some environment,
          and use that to access resources in that environment, including on remote hosts.
          I have a <a href="./constructive.html">constructive proof</a> of this:
          <a href="https://github.com/catern/rsyscall">rsyscall</a>.
        <li><a href="./list_singledist.html">Distributed languages</a>
          (including libraries that make existing languages into distributed lanaguages)
          let you write libraries which access remote resources.
        <li><a href="./supervisors.html">Process supervisors</a> can be replaced with a library.
      </ul>
    <p>
  <li>Have access to resources that the rest of the program isn't allowed to access.
    <p>
    For example:
    <ul>
      <li>Javascript running in a browser can access functionality provided by the browser as a library;
        the browser and the Javascript are running at different privilege levels.
      <li>An object in a type-safe language can contain
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">capabilities</a>
        for resources which it uses to implement its methods,
        without those capabilities being available to the code calling those methods.
      <li>Java-style
        <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/796/how-does-stack-inspection-work">stack inspection</a>
        can restrict user or library code to deny access at runtime to unauthorized methods.
        <!-- good paper about stack inspection: 
             https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usits97/full_papers/gong/gong.pdf -->
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_addressing">Capability-safe architectures</a>
        such as
        <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>
        prevent code from accessing memory that it doesn't have an explicit capability for.
      <li><a href="https://cs155.stanford.edu/papers/sfi.pdf">Software fault isolation</a>
        can allow
        <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/242/f96/notes/prot/node11.html">Multics-style "call gates"</a>,
        where a library has a different privilege level from other code.
    </ul>
    <p>
      You might be concerned about using such fancy techniques. Sometimes, they aren't necessary,
      because the whole program can safely be given access to the supposedly-privileged resource,
      perhaps because the resource is one more of:
    <ul>
      <li>fast to create (so we can just create them on the fly in the library)
      <li>cheap to create (so we can give every user their own)
      <li>already multiplexed and safe to share
        (it's amazing how easy it is to miss this if you don't explicitly think about it)
      <li>easily tweaked to be shareable (for example, a resource could be leased out to a user then reset when they're done)
      <li>or otherwise safe or can be made safe to give to users directly
    </ul>
    <p>
    Consider this carefully; this point is often non-obvious.
    <p>
</ul>
<!--
 !-- One issue is that C is the standard way to write language-independent type signatures,

 !-- That means that if you want to write a language-independent library,

 !-- The C type sysem is more expressive than protocol schemas,

<!-- hmm well, also protocol schemas are nicer in many ways...
     variable sized data, etc...
     which would imply they're superior for language-independent libraries...
