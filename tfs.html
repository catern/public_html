<h1>Write code, not compilers</h1>
To convert a function into some other type
(executable code, or a pretty-printed program, or something else),
the easiest way is to call the function,
passing certain arguments,
such that the desired type is returned from the function.
<p>
A function does not need to be parsed and statically analyzed to figure out what it does.
The function itself will tell you: Just call it and see.
<p>
It will tell you in the language that you ask for,
using the arguments you pass it.
<ul>
  <li>If you pass it objects and methods which perform IO and return unit,
    it will tell you in the language of side-effects.
  <li>If you pass it objects and methods which pretty-print their arguments and return a string,
    it will tell you in the language of pretty-printed programs.
  <li>If you pass it objects and methods which allocate registers and return instructions,
    it will tell you in the language of executable code.
</ul>
The fewer global variables and types that a function refers to,
the more the function can speak in the language we desire,
rather than a hard-coded predetermined langauge.
