<h1>Exit and voice in free/open source software</h1>
Quoting Wikipedia on the classic social science text,
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</a>":
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">
  The basic concept is as follows: members of an organization,
  whether a business, a nation or any other form of human grouping,
  have essentially two possible responses when they perceive that the
  organization is demonstrating a decrease in quality or benefit to
  the member: they can exit (withdraw from the relationship); or,
  they can voice (attempt to repair or improve the relationship
  through communication of the complaint, grievance or proposal for
  change). For example, the citizens of a country may respond to
  increasing political repression in two ways: emigrate or
  protest. Similarly, employees can choose to quit their unpleasant
  job, or express their concerns in an effort to improve the
  situation. Disgruntled customers can choose to shop elsewhere, or
  they ask for the manager.
</blockquote>
Exit and voice are also two possible strategies for a software user,
who might be one person, or an organization of multiple people.
<p>
If the software changes in a way that the user dislikes,
or if the user would prefer that the software change but the software is not changing,
both "exit" and "voice" are available.
<ul>
  <li>Voice: A user can file bugs, complain, and request that the software developer make the user's desired changes.
  <li>Exit: Or the user can switch to using some other piece of software which is more to their liking,
    paying various switching costs, like learning to use the new software.
</ul>
One interesting thing is that for open source software,
those are not the only options.
<p>
For open source software,
both the user and the original software developer have the same power to change the software.
<p>
If the original developer refuses to make some change,
the user can find some other person with programming skill,
and ask (or pay) them to make the change instead.
<p>
Let's call this ability "fork".
That's a bit of a misnomer, because this sense of "forking" doesn't have to be acrimonious or even public.
A user might make some private change to the software
which they know wouldn't be accepted into the main version,
while still making other changes as part of the main community.
<p>
The ability to "fork" has implications for "exit" and "voice".
<h3>Exit is less important for open source</h3>
In different situations - not just in software - "exit" can be easier or harder.
For example, someone working in a small town will have fewer job opportunities than someone working in a big city,
so exiting a bad job is harder.
Since exit is essentially one's only option if voice fails,
people will do things to make exit easier - like taking a job in a big city where they'll have lots of options.
<p>
One of the key influences on the ability to "exit" in software is portability.
Portable software can be used on different platforms or with different dependencies
and portable data formats can be read by different programs.
<p>
For example,
if a piece of software depends on a certain non-portable feature of a proprietary library,
the piece of software can't stop using the proprietary library.
They're reliant on "voice" to make sure that the proprietary library changes only in good ways.
<p>
If the piece of software instead only depends on such portable, widely available features of the proprietary library,
then if the proprietary library changes in a bad way,
the proprietary library can just be switched out for some other library.
<p>
Such easy "exit" is the primary motivation for portability.
<p>
With the ability to fork,
exit becomes less important,
and so portability becomes less of a priority.
<p>
If, as in the example before, a piece of software depends on a non-portable feature of an open source library,
and the open source library changes in a bad way,
the piece of software can fork the open source library and continue using it.
<p>
So it's less important for software only use portable features of open source dependencies.
<h3>TODO: Voice is less important for open source</h3>
There's less attempting to persuade people,
and more just-do-it.
Because that's a realistic option to demonstrate things work!
<h3>When forking becomes harder, exit and voice become more important</h3>
The "fork" ability relies on the user being able to
get a complete copy of the resources used by the original software developer.
Anything the original software developer can do, the user can now do.
<p>
This is only an approximation of the truth, of course.
<p>
Most basically,
the original software developer has a development environment and knowledge about the structure of the software,
which you don't automatically get a copy of.
<p>
A community-friendly project will try to make it easy to create a development environment
so that the software can be built.
Other projects, sometimes intentionally, will make it harder to build modified versions of the software.
<p>
In either case, a development environment is usually relatively easy to recreate.
<p>
If the software is primarily used as a network service,
there are more significant resources that are harder to recreate.
<p>
For a conventional local application which runs on the user's machine,
a modified version can be compiled and the user can switch to using it with no change in functionality.
<p>
A network service, on the other hand,
may use significant resources, both hardware and proprietary software,
which a fork will not be able to access.
<p>
Actually running a modified but otherwise equivalent network service is therefore difficult.
The practices and software that allow the network service to be maintained and provided
are often completely "proprietary" - not included with a fork.
<p>
All this weakens the ability to fork and forces software users to depend more on exit and voice,
even if the network service is running open source software.
<!-- Should include more reasons here why forking can be hard - K suggests dependencies on other things can do that??? -->
