<h1>Exit and voice in open source software</h1>
Quoting Wikipedia on the classic social science text,
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</a>":
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">
  The basic concept is as follows: members of an organization,
  whether a business, a nation or any other form of human grouping,
  have essentially two possible responses when they perceive that the
  organization is demonstrating a decrease in quality or benefit to
  the member: they can exit (withdraw from the relationship); or,
  they can voice (attempt to repair or improve the relationship
  through communication of the complaint, grievance or proposal for
  change). For example, the citizens of a country may respond to
  increasing political repression in two ways: emigrate or
  protest. Similarly, employees can choose to quit their unpleasant
  job, or express their concerns in an effort to improve the
  situation. Disgruntled customers can choose to shop elsewhere, or
  they ask for the manager.
</blockquote>
Exit and voice are also two possible strategies for a software user,
who might be one person, or an organization of multiple people.
<p>
If the user would like the software to change,
or would like it to stop changing,
they can employ either "exit" or "voice".
<ul>
  <li>Voice: A user can file bugs, complain, and request that the software developer make the user's desired changes.
  <li>Exit: Or the user can switch to using some other piece of software which is more to their liking,
    and pay large upfront switching costs, such as learning to use the new software.
</ul>
<h3>Open source provides a third option: fork</h3>
For open source software, there's a third option.
Both the user and the original software developer have the same power to change the software.
So if the original developer refuses to make some change,
the user can find some other person with programming skill,
and ask (or pay) them to make the change instead.
<p>
Let's call this ability "fork".
That's a bit of a misnomer, because this sense of "forking" doesn't have to be acrimonious or even public.
A user might make some private change to the software
which they know wouldn't be accepted into the main version,
while still making other changes as part of the main community.
<p>
This isn't like "voice";
the user doesn't have to persuade a specific group to make the change.
And this isn't like "exit";
the user doesn't have to pay large upfront switching costs,
just the ongoing costs of maintenance
which are proportional to the fork's divergence from the main version.
<p>
The ability to fork has implications for "exit" and "voice".
<h3>Exit is less important for open source</h3>
In different situations - not just in software - "exit" can be easier or harder.
For example, someone working in a small town will have fewer job opportunities than someone working in a big city,
so exiting a bad job is harder in the small town.
<p>
Since exit is essentially one's only option if voice fails,
people will do things to make exit easier - like taking a job in a big city where there are many other jobs.
<p>
Users (which might be other software) which are "portable" for a certain dependency
can easily exit that dependency.
That is, they can easily switch to different implementations of that dependency.
Typically, the key to portability is using "portable features" (ones which are widely available in other implementations)
and avoiding "non-portable features" (ones which are not available in other implementations).
<p>
For example,
imagine there's a piece of software "FooSoft" and a proprietary library "libprop",
and that FooSoft depends on non-portable features of libprop.
If libprop changes (or refuses to change) in bad ways,
FooSoft is reliant on voice to prevent (or cause) that change, because exit is hard.
<p>
If FooSoft instead sticks to only portable features of libprop,
then if libprop changes in a bad way,
FooSoft can exit easily.
libprop can just be switched out for some other implementation.
So, to preserve the ability to exit,
FooSoft would prefer to only use portable features of libprop.
<p>
But imagine that there's an open source library "libopen".
If FooSoft depends on non-portable features of libopen,
then it will be hard for FooSoft to exit libopen.
But this inability to exit libopen is less important,
because FooSoft still has the option to fork if they want certain changes;
this fork might only involve a few private patches to tweak some small behavior.
<p>
In general, it's less important for users to only use portable features of open source software.
That's because the ability to fork open source software
makes it less important to preserve the ability to exit that software.
<h3>Voice is less important for open source</h3>
In the use of "voice" in software, there are two participants, the user and the developer.
<ul>
  <li>A user wants some change, so they ask the developer to do it.
  <li>The developer receives a request from the user for some change.
</ul>
The behavior of both sides is changed by the ability to fork.
<ul>
  <li>The user can invest less effort into persuading the developer,
    because they can ultimately just make the change themselves (or pay someone to do it).
    Also, the user is able to more easily <a href="./constructive.html">prove</a>
    the goodness of their proposals
    by implementing them in a fork and showing that to the developer.
  <li>The developer can dismiss user requests more readily,
    knowing that that the user has options other than "exit".
    Also, the developer can require that the user <a href="./constructive.html">implement</a>
    and demonstrate the change with a long-lived fork,
    before applying the change to the main version.
</ul>
On both sides, some of the effort that would otherwise be spent on voice
is instead shifted to implementation work through forking.
<p>
One might compare this to a (possibly apocryhal) process for achieving change inside large corporations:
Leave the company, start a startup implementing the change and demonstrating that it works,
and then have the company buy that startup.
The ability to fork makes this process much faster.
<h3>When forking becomes harder, exit and voice become more important</h3>
The "fork" ability relies on the user being able to
get a complete copy of the resources used by the original software developer.
Anything the original software developer can do, the user can now do.
<p>
This is only an approximation of the truth, of course.
When the original developer has resources that aren't copied in a fork,
forking becomes harder.
<p>
Some resources that might not be duplicated in a fork:
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge about the structure of the software.
    <p>
    This can be mitigated by good documentation, but of course can never be truly solved.
  <li>Development environments.
    <p>
    This can be especially troublesome when the software depends on specialty hardware.
    A community-friendly project will try to make it easy to create a development environment
    so that the software can be built.
    Other projects, sometimes intentionally, will make it harder to build modified versions of the software.
  <li>Everyone else working on the software.
    <p>
    New features will continue to be added to the main version;
    to incorporate these, a fork needs to regularly rebase on the latest main version.
    Rebasing becomes harder the more the fork diverges from the main version.
    Thus a fork will want to keep its divergence from the main version to a minimum,
    and will use voice and exit, among other tools, to achieve that.
  <li>For open source software provided as a network service:
    The hardware and software used to host the service.
    <p>
    Even if a service is open source,
    the resources used to host that service are not duplicated in a fork.
    Most obviously, unlike normal application software which runs on the user's computer,
    a service depends on computers controlled by the service provider.
    To use the service, the user must <a href="./freedist.html">set up copies</a>
    of such machines,
    rather than simply <a href="./run.html">run the software</a> locally.
</ul>
All this weakens the ability to fork and forces software users to depend more on exit and voice.
