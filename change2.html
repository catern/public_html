<h1>Be willing to change anything to resolve your problem</h1>
When you are thinking about how to resolve a problem,
you should spend some of that time thinking about unusual changes that might resolve the problem,
rather than only thinking about conventional, palatable changes.
Sometimes, an unusual change is the optimal solution,
and if you never think about unusual changes,
you'll choose suboptimal solutions.
<p>
Some examples of changes which often seem unpalatable:
<ul>
 <li>Changing your goals to avoid the problem
 <li>Changing something controlled by other people
 <li>Changing things you don't currently know how to change
 <li>Changes whose effects you don't currently know
 <li>Changes that are expensive or will take a long time
 <li>Changing old, fundamental, well-established, rarely-changed things
</ul>
Some examples of thinking about them:
<ul>
 <li>A friend was considering the best way to store leftover food,
  particularly pizza,
  because pizza boxes didn't fit in their small refrigerator.
  They considered putting it in various containers or wrapping it in foil,
  but they didn't consider getting a bigger refrigerator,
  which turned out to be the best solution.
 <li>An engineer was considering how to deal with some noisy not-useful log messages
  produced by another team's software.
  They considered various schemes to filter out those log messages,
  but didn't consider simply deleting the logging code.
  It turned out that the other team was happy to delete the logging code:
  the other team found the log messages noisy and not-useful too.

Evaluating proposals that include radical changes can be difficult.
For example,
a proposal to rewrite everything from scratch can seem like a good idea when considered on its individual merits,
but such proposals, when implemented, usually turn out badly.
Make sure to incorporate heuristics like this when evaluating any proposal.
as well as other techniques
like consulting experts and writing out costs and benefits.
You can practice by making predictions and checking if they were accurate.

Considering radical changes is a m

These fixed-seeming constraints limit the possible solutions;
part of your time should be spent searching that limited solution space,
and part of your time should be spent searching a broader space.

Part of your time should be spent on trying to solve that specific problem within the ordinary limited solution space,
and part of your time should be spent searching a broader space
for solutions which require larger changes,
but are overall better - simpler, cheaper, faster, easier to implement, easier to use, higher-quality, better long-term.
<p>
One useful shift in perspective is to remember that
you are always acting within that broader space,
and your goal in that broader space is not to solve a specific problem,
but to make a better world.
When you choose to do constrained search,
it's for reasons of practicality,
not because you are yourself constrained in this way.
Any ideas which suggest you are constrained in this way -
that searching the broad space is the responsibility of others,
or that it should only be done when socially appropriate
- are wrong.
<p>
Evaluating proposals in the broad search space can be difficult.
For example,
a proposal to radically rework everything can seem like a good idea when considered on its individual merits,
but radical reworks, when implemented, usually turn out to be bad solutions.
Make sure to incorporate heuristics like this
to improve your ability to evaluate solutions,
as well as other techniques
like consulting experts and writing out costs and benefits.
You can practice by making predictions and checking if they were accurate.
<!--
 !-- Many organizational policies can make such search easier, too,
 !-- such as conditional prediction markets on proposal outcomes.
  -->
<p>
Balancing the amount of time spent on constrained search and the amount of time spent on broad search
is an important skill.
This, too, can be improved by various techniques,
as well as explicit practice.
In my experience,
most people spend too little time on broad search.
Therefore, you should err on the side of broad search
until you have a better understanding of the balance.
