<h1>TSINT Software Engineer Job Description</h1>
The Two Sigma Securities Integration (TSINT) focus group deals with the Two Sigma trading system as a whole,
and is tasked with making the system simple, unified, runnable and reusable.
TSINT's general architecture and focus is described <a href="http://catern.com/integration.html">here</a>.
If you think this sounds cool, you may be a good fit.
<p>
As an engineer on TSINT, you will work on many systems and technologies throughout the company
to make the trading system better as a whole.
Your work will be significantly self-directed, collaborating with many other teams to make improvements,
depending on what areas you judge will give the best reward for investment.
<p>
You will work to improve the whole trading system, by:
<ul>
<li>Making changes anywhere in the system, wherever necessary to reduce complexity
<li>Develop workflows and technologies to support whole system integration, testing, and benchmarking
<li>Work with other teams to both develop standards and modify systems to meet those standards
<li>Create and maintain common libraries and fundamental abstractions in use by many systems
</ul>
<p>
Some skills/experience that would be useful, and why we want them, in descending order of importance:
