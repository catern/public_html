<h1>Technical advantages of open source software</h1>
The main motivation for open source software is the social, ethical and organizational advantages of open source over proprietary software.
For example, open source has a larger pool of possible contributors.
<p>
The technical advantages of open source over proprietary software are far less frequently discussed,
and sometimes people are not even aware they exist.
Open source gives you options that are impossible with proprietary software,
though you might choose not to take those options in practice.
Here's a partial list of some of those options.
<ul>
  <li>You can have a single repository of source code containing both the code providing an API, and the code using that API,
    allowing easy <a href="https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/">system-wide refactorings</a>.
  <li>Relatedly, you don't have to provide a
    <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst">stable plugin API</a>
    to extend your system;
    extensions can be maintained in that same repository and benefit from the same system-wide refactorings.
    <!-- Besides Linux, see also C:DDA, which has mods in the main rpeo -->
    <!-- or see DCSS, which doesn't even have a modding API; people just fork instead -->
  <li>You can ship software as source code
    and then have the end-user run source-code-level safety-verification on it
    to ensure that the source code won't violate memory safety or access objects it's not allowed to access.
    Among other things, this makes it easy to avoid the "<a href="./microkernels.html">microkernel</a>" antipattern.
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-carrying_code">Proof-carrying code</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">bytecode virtual machines</a>
    are two alternatives for doing this which work for proprietary software,
    but they require you to write a lot more code;
    if you ship the source code, you can use the compiler you already have for verification)
  <li>Your users can <a href="./run.html">run your code</a>,
    so they can actually test against your software.
  <li>Your dependencies can run your code as a <a href="./usertests.html">test suite</a>.
  <li>You don't have to ship binaries for many different platforms; package managers will handle that,
    if you're willing to rely on them.

> wrote a quick note about the technical advantages of free software http://catern.com/freetech.html
<moon-child> catern: that seems geared towards a very specific set of application types
<moon-child> which admittedly probably comprise a majority, but I think it would be good to say in what cases those arguments are applicable
> could you elaborate? concretely what do you think this doesn't apply to?
<moon-child> software which is developed and used entirely internally
<moon-child> in particular, this seems to be geared towards fsf-style 'free' defined software; that is, it's advantageous for source code to be available to people who interact with it; but doesn't argue why it's useful to let people interact with your software in the first place.  Which, again, is frequently a given for many business models and applications, but I think it's worthwhile to mention it
> I'm not sure I understand
> isn't it useful for anyone to, e.g., avoid the need to maintain yet another stable API?
<moon-child> catern: at my work, we have an interpreter which is only used by employees.  It's not exposed to anyone else; there's no secondary api to maintain.  Why is it advantageous in this case to opensource it?
> well, it's already open source
> in most senses anyway
> you can run, modify, distribute, and distribute modified versions of the software (although only to other employees)
<moon-child> my understanding of the term is that it refers to software whose source code is made publically and 'open'ly available
> but I see what you mean now
> I misread "software which is developed and used entirely internally" as you saying that was the category of software that this *does* apply to
> I'll have to think about this but thanks for this observation
<moon-child> ahh, I see
> (totally my bad in misunderstanding, I see now your critique and it does make sense, will need to think about it)

  <!-- 
right so I'd argue it's essentially open source.
but... yeah... how does this relate?

cuz obvious
 -->
  <!-- 
umm okay so what about...
for internal stuff, usertests against the services you're depending on?

and, what about the benefit of... helping your neighbor by distributing...
 -->

</ul>
These advantages apply if you're providing a service to users,
but what if your software is entirely internal to a given company?

Well, then you already (presumably) have access to the source code and can apply all these techniques whether the software is open source or not.
<!-- actually maybe I should put this note in the introduction?
     I can explain this is, like, for someone providing software to other people,
     and listing the technical advantages for that person of being open source...
