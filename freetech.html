<h1>Technical advantages of open source software</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can have a single source repository containing both the code providing an API, and the code using that API,
    allowing easy <a href="https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/">system-wide refactorings</a>.
  <li>Relatedly, you don't have to provide a
    <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst">stable plugin API</a>.
    <!-- See also C:DDA, which has mods in the main rpeo -->
  <li>You can safely ship your software as source code,
    meaning you don't have to support verification or analysis on compiled binaries.
    This makes it easy to avoid the <a href="http://catern.com/microkernels.html">"microkernel"</a> antipattern.
  <li>You and your users can actually <a href="http://catern.com/run.html">run the software</a>.
  <li>You don't have to ship binaries for many different platforms; package managers will handle that.
    (Although it's not clear that this one is a purely technical advantage, it might be a social one.)
