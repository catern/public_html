<title>Write code, not configuration</title>
<h1>Write code, not configuration</h1>
When you write a program which might use one of multiple implementations,
or needs to connect to some URL,
or needs some information to function,
your first step should be to just hardcode it.
Use one implementation, hardcode one URL, use one specific piece of information.
<p>
If, after doing so, you find that you need another program
with different hardcoded information,
turn your program into a function.
Take the implementation as an argument,
take the URL as an argument,
take the information you need as an argument.
<p>
And then just call that function with the arguments you prefer,
each time you need a program with different "configuration".
<p>
You don't need to load those arguments from some file on disk,
or by querying some database or service,
or even by taking them as command line parameters.
<p>
Just make a separate program for each case.
<p>
For a batch job, this might mean a few different executables,
tweaked and rebuilt frequently over time as one's needs change.
<p>
  For a user-facing application, this might mean that each user runs their own
  <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Doc-Configuring.html">custom</a>
  <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">executable</a>,
compiled for or by them, with pre-compiled shared libraries common between all users.
<p>
For a daemon providing some network service and connecting to other services,
this might mean 10 or so different executables,
which are run in the 10 or so different availability zones or datacenters or sorts of machines
on which this daemon is deployed.
Or for a more heterogeneous deployment,
it might mean many thousands of different executables,
deployed to many thousands of different environments,
each layered on top of a common image with shared libraries identical between all deployments.
<p>
If you want to share information between multiple programs with different configurations,
share it in the same way you share code: with a library.
<p>
If you want to make your configuration more dynamic,
write code to dynamically determine the arguments to pass.
<p>
If you want to make rapid changes and don't want to wait for builds,
call the function from a REPL, or rely on fast incremental builds.
<p>
If you want to see what arguments are being passed to your function in your program,
use logging and debuggers, according to your preference.
<p>
Code written in this way in your actual programming language
is far more expressive than code written in a configuration DSL,
like JSON, YAML, or Dhall.
<p>
In a configuration DSL,
one would select from multiple implementations by manipulating some identifier for the implementations;
a string or a sum type, perhaps.
This might be formatted in an invalid way,
or might be from the wrong version,
or might be incompatible,
or any number of possible issues.
<p>
But in any general-purpose programming language,
implementations are first class values which can be passed around and manipulated,
whether as an object, a module, a struct of function pointers, or something else.
One can write a function (or a template, a functor, a macro, or something else)
which takes the implementation directly as an argument,
with no possibility of issues due to mismatches between a string identifier and the actually available implementations.
<p>
In a typical configuration DSL,
we would specify a set of key-value pairs to configure some component.
We might run some validator over the DSL to ensure it matches some schema
which we know our code will eventually load.
<p>
But static checks in general purpose programming languages, such as type checkers,
perform "validation" of the "schema" of our configuration for free,
wherever we pass arguments to functions.
Required arguments must be present, and even must be of the correct type,
and there's no need to keep our code in sync with a schema.
<p>
Writing code in your general purpose language
is easier, faster, and better
than writing separate configuration.
<p>
Of course, this is all easier with faster and more powerful build systems,
like Nix,
or with interpreted or fast-building languages,
like Python,
or with, at least, shared libraries and a fast link step,
like dynamic libraries in C.
<p>
If you're on a slow, weak, and hard-to-use build system,
with a slow-building language,
and you have slow linking,
then you probably want to fix one or more of those issues first;
although if your programs are small, even those issues are not necessarily prohibitive.
<p>
And you might also be in a corporate environment,
where code changes require an extensive and painful process,
but configuration changes can be made relatively easily.
If so, consider quitting.
