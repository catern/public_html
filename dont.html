<h1>Don't do things you don't want to do</h1>
Sometimes I need to remind myself:
If I don't want to do something, I can just not do it.
<p>
For example, in undergrad I was double-majoring in computer science and another major,
and hating the classes for the other major.
Even though I loved the subject matter behind the other major,
and enjoyed talking with the professors,
I found many of the ancillary required classes dull and poorly taught,
and I was having much more fun in my CS classes.
<p>
I forced myself to stick through it for a while, but then I thought:
"Don't do things you don't want to do".
And so I dropped my double major, and took more computer science courses instead.
<p>
Generally, whenever I'm faced with some thing that I don't want to do...
I can just not do it.
I just have to remind myself of this.
<p>
I'm very fortunate that on the long list of things I'm interested in,
there is computer science,
which pays well and which I'm good at.
But that's not really what I mean when I think "don't do things you don't want to do".
<p>
Sometimes I feel pressured to be a little more normal and balanced in my interests.
If I went outside more,
I'd have non-computer things to talk to other people about,
when they ask what I've been up to lately.
<p>
But I don't want to go outside more and balance my interests,
I want to do computer science.
So I don't bow to the pressure to be "normal",
because I can just... not do things that I don't want to do.
<p>
My website is plain static HTML with no CSS or JS.
It's easy to read in source form.
I edit it directly in-place.
That pleases me.
<p>
It could probably be easier for some people to read in a browser
if I made it more complex,
added some CSS and JS,
used a static site generator, etc.
And if it was easier to read, then more people would read it,
which would benefit me in some nebulous way.
But I don't want to do that.
So I remind myself, "don't do things you don't want to do",
and so I don't.
<p>
Sometimes, I have to do things, even if I don't want to do them.
For example, I have to file US taxes if I want to stay in the US.
It's easy for me to get in a state of mind where I think everything is like that,
but I think most things are not like that.
I have alternatives, and I have leverage,
so if I don't want to do something, it's possible for me to just not do it.
<p>
This is kind of a
<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/09/all-debates-are-bravery-debates/">bravery debate</a>
and I'm not sure if it's useful for anyone else.
But it's something I occasionally have to say to myself,
so maybe it's useful for someone else to hear it too.
