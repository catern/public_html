<h1>Write libraries instead of services, where possible</h1>
  A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider.
  A library instead moves these costs to the users of the library.
<p>
  For any developer with limited resources,
  <!-- obviously everyone has limited resources, but I feel like this makes the sentence scan better, shrug -->
  this means a library (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user,
  at a lower cost to the developer than a service.
<p>
  By library, I mean any software that can be <a href="./run.html">run by the user</a>:
  shared objects, modules, servers, command line utilities, and others.
  By service, I mean any software which the user can't run on their own;
  anything which depends (usually through an API)
  on a service provider for its functionality.
<p>
  Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services.
  People say, "services are easy to write because you can upgrade them centrally,
  so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse."
<p>
  But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else.
  If one user can't have a negative impact on other users,
  then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade;
  they're only hurting themselves.
<p>
  You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users;
  in other words, <a href="./run.html">let users run the software</a>
  themselves, by writing libraries instead of services.
<p>
  "Write a library", in this sense, can still mean writing a standalone server reached through a network protocol.
  As long as the user runs the server themselves, you're still saving the administration costs.
  Both standalone servers and importable code are <a href="./schemas.html">equally expressive</a>,
  and equally cheap for you to administrate if you're not operating a service yourself.
<p>
  By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service,
  a library can afford to contain more functionality.
  That's good for both the developer and the user.
