<h1>Write tools instead of services, where possible</h1>
  A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider.
  A tool, run by the user or incorporated into the user's code,
  instead moves these costs to the users of the tool.
<p>
  For any developer with limited resources,
  <!-- obviously everyone has limited resources, but I feel like this makes the sentence scan better, shrug -->
  this means a tool (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user,
  at a lower cost to the developer than a service.
<p>
  By tool, I mean any software that can be <a href="./run.html">run by the user</a>:
  libraries, servers, command line utilities, and others.
  By service, I mean any software which the user can't run on their own;
  anything which depends (usually through an API)
  on a service provider for its functionality.
<p>
  Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services.
  People say, "services are easy to write because you can upgrade them centrally,
  so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse."
<p>
  But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else.
  If one user can't have a negative impact on other users,
  then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade;
  they're only hurting themselves.
<p>
  You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users;
  in other words, let users run the software themselves, by writing tools instead of services.
<p>
  One easy way to write a tool rather than a service,
  is to write a library rather than a server.
  While a server can be <a href="./run.html">run by users</a> just as well,
  libraries are typically easier to use and run.
  <a href="./schemas.html">Libraries are much more capable</a> than many people think,
  so this is possible in a wide variety of scenarios.
<p>
  By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service,
  a tool can afford to contain more functionality.
  That's good for both the developer and the user.
