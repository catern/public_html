<h1>Write libraries instead of services, where possible</h1>
  A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider.
  A properly designed library instead moves these costs to the users of the library.
<p>
  For any developer with limited resources,
  <!-- obviously everyone has limited resources, but I feel like this makes the sentence scan better, shrug -->
  this means a library (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user,
  at a lower cost to the developer than a service.
<p>
  Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services.
  People say, "services are easy because you can upgrade them centrally,
  so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse."
<p>
  But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else.
  If one user can't have a negative impact on other users,
  then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade;
  they're only hurting themselves.
<p>
  You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users;
  in other words, by avoiding services.
<p>
  For example, a common scenario is an developer creating a library and a service together,
  and later discovering that the (now already deployed) library has some bug or incompatibility,
  and needs to be upgraded everywhere before the service can be improved.
  A big headache,
  which might naively suggest that functionality should be moved from the library to the service
  so that it can be more easily upgraded.
<p>
  But if you didn't have the service in the first place - if there was only the library,
  containing all the functions,
  doing whatever the service was supposed to do in the first place -
  you wouldn't have this problem.
  Users who don't upgrade would suffer whatever problem exists in the initial version of the library,
  and everyone else would be fine.
<p>
  Avoiding services completely in this way isn't always possible;
  but it's possible more often than people think.
  Some ideas along these lines to consider:
<ul>
  <li>Instead of manipulating resources from a service,
    you can directly call the underlying primitives from a library.
    In effect, the user then relies on the more stable services that are maintained by someone else,
    like the Linux kernel or Kubernetes.
    If you want to abstract over them - a library can do that too just fine.
    <p>
    Some good examples of services that can be avoided in this way
    are <a href="./supervisors.html">process supervisors</a>
    or <a href="./progsys.html">configuration management systems</a>.
  <li>If the underlying primitives and resources cannot be safely accessed by regular users,
    they can't use a library which accesses them.
    One might conclude that a service is needed to safely share those resources between multiple users;
    indeed that's practically the <em>definition</em> of a "service".
    <p>
      However, with some thought, often we actually <em>can</em> safely give users access to those resources,
      and so a library can work fine.
      Many resources don't actually need to be multiplexed by yet another service,
      perhaps because they're one or more of:
    <ul>
      <li>fast to create (so we can just create them on the fly in the library)
      <li>cheap to create (so we can give every user their own)
      <li>already multiplexed and safe to share
        (it's amazing how easy it is to miss this if you don't explicitly think about it)
      <li>easily tweaked to be shareable (for example, a resource could be leased out to a user then reset when they're done)
      <li>or otherwise safe or can be made safe to give to users directly
    </ul>
    Consider this carefully; this point is often non-obvious.
  <li>Perhaps we really can't give users access to the underlying primitives.
    But that doesn't mean a service is our only option to provide privilege separation between the user and the library.
    <p>
    If user code is running on a sufficiently advanced platform, one not administered by the user,
    then a library can safely manipulate resources that aren't accessible to the rest of the program.
    For example:
    <ul>
      <li>An object in a type-safe language can contain capabilities for resources which it uses to implement its methods,
        without those capabilities being available to the code calling those methods.
      <li>Java-style
        <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/796/how-does-stack-inspection-work">stack inspection</a>
        can restrict user or library code to deny access at runtime to unauthorized methods.
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_addressing">Capability-safe architectures</a>
        such as
        <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>
        prevent code from accessing memory that it doesn't have an explicit capability for.
      <li><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub35649/">Software fault isolation</a>
        can allow <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/242/f96/notes/prot/node11.html">Multics-style "call gates"</a>,
        where a library has a different privilege level from other code.
    </ul>
    Admittedly, only the first of these is particularly common.
  <li>Maintaining a stable, backwards-compatible interface is relatively straightforward for services
    thanks to the support provided by many common protocols with features which ease compatibility
    (protocol buffers, JSON, etc).
    <p>
      But this is also possible with a library.
      Indeed, a library is strictly more powerful here;
      there's no reason you can't use those same protocols for a local library,
      and enjoy the same compatibility benefits.
  <li>If you must, you can still update a library without user involvement, by using
    <a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/no_static_linking.html">dynamic linking</a> for your library.
    Basic dynamic linking still requires a process restart to get new libraries,
    but more advanced techniques, such as automatically reloading the library on each call,
    allow upgrading things at any moment without your users knowing.
    <p>
    These days, dynamic linking is often criticized,
    for the same reasons upgrading a service without involving your users at all is criticized,
    so consider carefully whether you want to do it.
    If you're fully avoiding services, such upgrades won't be necessary.
</ul>

Through these ideas and others,
it's often possible to create a library instead of a service.
<p>
By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service,
a library can afford to contain more functionality.
That's good for both the developer and the user.
