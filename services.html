<h1>Write libraries instead of services, where possible</h1>
  A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider.
  A properly designed library instead moves these costs to the users of the library.
<p>
  For any developer with limited resources,
  <!-- obviously everyone has limited resources, but I feel like this makes the sentence scan better, shrug -->
  this means a library (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user,
  at a lower cost to the developer than a service.
<p>
  Let's be clear about the meaning of "library" and "service" here;
  a "library"
<p>
  Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services.
  People say, "services are easy because you can upgrade them centrally,
  so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse."
<p>
  But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else.
  If one user can't have a negative impact on other users,
  then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade;
  they're only hurting themselves.
<p>
  You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users;
  in other words, let the users <a href="<a href="./run.html">">run their own copy of the service</a>.
<p>
  One easy way to let the user run the service themselves is to write a library instead of a service.
  can be made even easier by avoiding services entirely:
  just write a library instead.
  This is more possible than you might think,
  because <a href="./schemas.html">libraries are much more capable</a>
  than many people think.
<p>
By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service,
a library can afford to contain more functionality.
That's good for both the developer and the user.
