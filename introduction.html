<h1>An introduction to "introduction": A common but rarely-named systems concept</h1>
Introduction is simple to describe:
It's when you (A) talk to some server B,
which gives you a way to communicate directly to (introduces you to) some other server C.
<p>
A few things which do introduction:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>A webserver (B) returns HTML which contains URLs which introduce you to other servers (C)
 <li>A query to a DNS server (B) can return an IP address which introduces you to another server (C)
 <li>Service discovery in general
</ul>
<p>
Introduction is not always simple to implement. In fact, it's more interesting when it's not simple.
<ul>
<li>
Consider an idealized video game matchmaking server.
You (A) talk to the matchmaking server (B),
and it identifies some other player (C) who you should play a match against.
<p>
But both you and the other player might be behind a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>,
which means the matchmaking server can't just give you the IP address of the other player and let you talk directly.
<p>
Instead, a
more complex process
of introduction (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">STUN</a>) has to happen,
coordinated by the matchmaking server (and possibly more servers),
which establishes a bidirectional direct connection, passing through the NAT, between you and the other player.
<p>
The presence of a NAT means there's not a single globally accessible address space where anyone can reach anyone else.
Instead, you have to go through a more complicated process to establish a channel for communication.
<li>
Another example is Unix domain sockets,
which like Internet sockets support sending and receiving raw bytes to a local Unix server,
but which also, through a feature called
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html">SCM_RIGHTS</a>,
allow you to send and receive /connections to servers/, in the form of file descriptors.
<p>
So if you (A) send a request to a Unix server (B),
then it can introduce you to another Unix server (C)
by sending you an already open connection to that server,
even if the server is inside a container or otherwise inaccessible to you.
</ul>
Note that introduction can be iterated.
Once I'm introduced to C,
C might in turn introduce me to still more servers:
D and E, which introduce F and G, and so on.
<p>
An example of something that is not introduction is a typical load-balancer.
You (A) talk to a load-balancer (B),
and then send and receive some data from another server,
but you're typically not in direct communication with the other server:
All your communication with that server is proxied through the load-balancer.
Among other differences, this creates a performance overhead.
<p>
Once you know what introduction is,
you begin to see it everywhere.
A short list of some more instances of introduction:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>When you use mosh, you ssh (A) to an sshd (B) which then tells you the secrets for connecting to mosh (C).
  <li>If you (A) call a method on an object (B) it might return to you another object (C).
  <li>The term "introduction" comes from Mark S. Miller's work on
    <a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/3vat.html">capabilities</a>,
    where the full term is "three-vat introduction",
    since each entity runs in a process-like context called a "vat".
    Three-vat introduction is when
    you in vat A receive a message from vat B containing a reference to an object in vat C.
</ul>
