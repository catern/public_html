<h1>My reasons to use Emacs</h1>
I think these are some good reasons to use Emacs.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Choosing-Software">Choosing Software</a>.
    This post is what originally inspired me to use Emacs,
    and influenced my tool choices and philosophy greatly besides that.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Intro.html">(info "(emacs) Intro")</a>.
    Emacs's own self-summary is modest, but worth reading.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html">(info "(emacs) Help")</a>.
    Emacs has probably the most advanced help system of any program.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">(info "(emacs) Dired")</a>.
    I do most of my navigation and manipulation of the filesystem through dired.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html">(info "(emacs) Wdired")</a>.
    Wdired is a quite easy way to do mass-renaming of files.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Remote-Files.html">(info "(emacs) Remote Files")</a>.
    Since Emacs works on remote files, I need only
    <a href="./computers.html">one instance</a>
    of Emacs to manage all my computation everywhere.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html">(info "(emacs) Projects")</a>.
    A collection of commands for working with projects, greatly expanded in Emacs 28.
    Especially useful in combination with <a href="https://github.com/purcell/envrc">envrc.el</a>.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell.html">(info "(emacs) Shell")</a>.
    When I do use a shell, I use it inside Emacs rather than using a terminal emulator.
    I never use full-screen terminal applications,
    insteading using Emacs or command line equivalents,
    so I never need an actual terminal.
  <li><a href="https://notmuchmail.org/notmuch-emacs/">notmuch.el</a>.
    I use Emacs to send and receive mail with notmuch, mbsync, and msmtp.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/">(info "(gnus) Top")</a>.
    I use Emacs to read mailing lists with Gnus,
    connecting to <a href="http://gmane.io/">gmane.io</a>
    or <a href="https://public-inbox.org/">public-inbox</a>
    NNTP interfaces.
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/circe">circe</a>.
    I use Emacs to chat on IRC and other networks with circe and
    <a href="https://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html">bitlbee</a>.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/info/index.html">(info "(info) Top")</a>.
    Info is a format for hypertext manuals.
    In the 90s, many people disliked Info, preferring traditional non-hypertext "Unix-y" manpages.
    Ironically, today documentation is mostly read in web browsers, which are even less "Unix-y".
    Anyway, some software (git, Python, etc) has documentation available in Info format,
    and the Emacs Info reader is a good way to refer to that documentation.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Man-Page.html">(info "(emacs) Man Page")</a>.
    Of course, one can also read man pages from Emacs.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Input-Methods.html">(info "(emacs) Input Methods")</a>.
    With <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/leim/quail/latin-ltx.el#n34">(describe-input-method "TeX")</a>
    you can, for example, type <code>\lambda</code> to get Î».
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Replace.html">(info "(emacs) Replace")</a>.
    Even simple "find and replace" is an advanced feature in Emacs.
    For example, arbitrary Lisp is allowed in replacement strings:
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexp-Replace.html">(info "(emacs) Regexp Replace")</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Pages.html">(info "(emacs) Pages")</a>.
    Pages are useful to separate text into sections.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Earlier-Kills.html">(info "(emacs) Earlier Kills")</a>.
    Being able to cycle through previously-copied text is useful.
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rectangles.html">(info "(emacs) Rectangles")</a>.
    Rectangles are fairly useful in a varietry of situations,
    though if text isn't aligned then a kmacro is more appropriate.
