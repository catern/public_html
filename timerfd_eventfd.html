<h1>timerfd is a specialized kind of eventfd</h1>
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html">
eventfd file descriptors</a>
and
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html">
timerfd file descriptors</a>
have compatible behavior when
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">
<code>read</code></a>
is called on them.
Thus, one can be substituted for the other without an application knowing,
assuming it only calls <code>read</code>.
<p>
For both,
you read exactly one 64-bit integer at a time, and if that integer would be 0, <code>read</code> blocks.
<p>
With timerfd, this is the number of timer expirations since the last <code>read</code>;
with eventfd, this is the number of events that have been written to the eventfd since the last <code>read</code>.
<p>
So, timerfd can be emulated by simply writing to an eventfd from a userspace process every N seconds.
<p>
Indeed, we can think of "timerfds" as a specialized kind of eventfd,
specially optimized by the kernel,
for the common case of triggering an event on a timer.
<p>
This opens up some interesting possibilities.
<p>
First, let's imagine that we live in a world where programs are habitually written in a object-capability style
using file descriptors.
Like with Capsicum or CloudABI or UCSPI.
<p>
In this world,
we could use timerfds rather than strings to configure things relating to time.
<p>
For example, rather than passing cron the text string <code>0 * * * *</code> to run a job every hour,
we could instead pass a timerfd which is configured to expire every hour.
Then cron would run select on that timerfd, among others,
and when a timerfd expires,
cron would run the relevant job.
<p>
One can imagine similar schemes for many other forms of time handling which currently are done with inert data.
<p>
Indeed, we could universally use timerfd for <em>all</em> interactions with time;
a well-designed program would never use <code>clock_gettime</code>,
but instead would only ever wait for various timerfds to expire.
<p>
Then, for programs that are designed to use timerfds in this way,
eventfd provides a way to put "time" under userspace control,
without use of privileges or namespaces.
<p>
A cron designed to use timerfds would not be just a way to run jobs at specific times.
Rather, it would be a fully generic tool for running a job on any event,
so long as it's notified of that event through an eventfd-compatible file descriptor,
which can be passed in to cron from any arbitrary external source.
<p>
Likewise for other programs;
rather than being bound to just working with time,
they can also work with any other kind of events.
<p>
Since time-based events are generally just approximations for the hard-to-work-with actual events,
this is a generally useful change.
Programs which today wait for an event by looping over a flag-check and a (timerfd-based) sleep,
can later wait directly for the event through an eventfd.
<p>
This would also be useful to ensure deterministic tests for applications which rely on time.
<p>
This increase in expressiveness is just a consequence
of the power of both the object-capability paradigm and Linux.
Using file descriptors as capabilities perfectly harmonizes this paradigm with Linux,
and allows for mechanisms like the one described here.
