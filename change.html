<h1>Be willing to change anything to resolve your problem</h1>
When searching for a solution to a problem,
the practical approach is to view some things (including the problem itself) as fixed and unchangeable constraints,
and other things as "free variables" that you can set to whatever you want.
But you should make sure to also perform a basic meta-search process
where you consider: what if you did change those things that seem like fixed constraints?
<p>
There are lots of things that seem like fixed constraints:
<ul>
 <li>Whatever is causing the problem
 <li>The requests ("requirements") of the people who want a solution to the problem
 <li>The scope and details of the problem itself
 <li>The features of the tools you have available to solve the problem
 <li>Things which are managed or controlled by other people
 <li>Things you don't know how to change
 <li>Things which you don't have experience in changing
 <li>Things which, if changed, will cause other problems
 <li>Things which would be expensive to change, or take a long time to change
 <li>Fundamental, well-established things which rarely change
 <li>Old things
</ul>
Sometimes the best solution will involve changing constraints which seem fixed,
and if you don't spend sufficient time thinking about that,
you'll systematically choose suboptimal solutions.
It might be that the best solution still doesn't involve changing any fixed-seeming constraint.
but it's still important to think about it!
<p>
Some examples:
<ul>
 <li>A friend was considering the best way to store leftover food,
  particularly pizza,
  because pizza boxes didn't fit in their small refrigerator.
  They considered putting it in various containers or wrapping it in foil,
  but until prompted,
  they didn't consider getting a bigger refrigerator,
  which turned out to be the best solution due to other reasons.
 <li>An engineer was considering how to deal with some noisy not-useful log messages
  produced by another team's software.
  They considered various schemes to filter out those messages,
  but didn't consider simply deleting the log messages.
  It turned out that the other team was happy to delete the logs:
  they found them noisy and not-useful too.
 <li>improving society? (changing human nature?? removing scarcity? transhumanism?)
  (building central cities vs remote work?)
</ul>
<p>
When you see a problem,
part of your time should be spent on trying to solve that specific problem within the ordinary limited solution space,
and part of your time should be spent searching a broader space
for solutions which require larger changes,
but are overall better - cheaper, faster, easier to implement, easier to use, higher-quality, better long-term.
<p>
One shift in perspective is to remember that
you always are acting within that broader space,
and your goal in that broader space is not to solve a specific problem,
but to make a better world.
When you choose to do constrained search,
it's for reasons of practicality,
not because you are yourself constrained in this way.
Any ideas which suggest you are constrained in this way -
that searching the broad space is the responsibility of others,
or that it should only be done when socially appropriate at specific times
- are wrong.
<p>
Evaluating proposals in the broad search space can be difficult;
for example,
a proposal to radical rework everything can seem like a good idea when considered on its individual merits,
but radical reworks, when implemented, usually turn out to be bad solutions.
Make sure to incorporate heuristics like this
to improve your ability to evaluate solutions,
as well as other techniques
like consulting experts and writing out costs and benefits.
You can practice by making predictions, aggregating them with others,
and scoring yourself on your predictive accuracy.
<p>
Balancing the amount of time spent on constrained search and the amount of time spent on broad search
is an important skill.
This, too, can be improved by various techniques,
as well as explicit practice.
In my experience,
most people spent too little time on broad search.
Therefore, you should err on the side of broad search
until you have a better understanding of the balance.
