<h1>Did you know you can actually change the code?</h1>
I can't count how many times
I've heard programmers talking about writing more code to work around an issue in some other code.
You are a programmer - you are allowed to change code!
In fact, it's your job!
Just change the code to do what you want!
Fix the bug! Change the behavior! Add the feature!
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Log message that's noisy and useless?
  Delete the logging code!
 <li>API that doesn't expose what you need?
  Add a new parameter!
 <li>Library that does something horrible that all your software depends on?
  Stop doing the horrible thing and add a shim for compatibility!
 <li>Open source software that's doing bad stuff?
  Patch it locally and send the patch upstream!
</ul>
<p>
There are some basic technical excuses one might give for why you aren't able to change the code.
For example:
<ul>
 <li>But I'm not allowed to touch code owned by other teams!
 <li>But I don't know how to change it!
 <li>But I don't know where the source code is!
 <li>But I can't build this software!
 <li>But I can't run the tests!
 <li>But I can't deploy a modified version of this software to production!
</ul>
However, you shouldn't be using any software where any of these are an issue,
and you should quit your job if they provide such poor developer tooling that those are real issues.
<p>
There are also some social/political excuses.
For example:
<ul>
 <li>But changing the code means we have to talk to the team that owns this code!
   <p>
  So what?
  They'll probably be happy that you're looking at their code and trying to improve it!
  If they aren't happy, they maybe what you're trying to do is evil anyway,
  and you should be thankful that they're stopping you!
  If what you're doing is good, but they're still not happy,
  then stop using their software!
 <li>But changing things will impact other users!
   <p>
  If what you are trying to do is good,
  then the impact on other users will be good,
  and you should embrace the costs and benefits of coordinating with them.
  If what you are trying to do is bad,
  then you should not do it.
 <li>But we haven't budgeted time to do it the right way!
   <p>
  Then you never will budget time to do it the right way.
  Do it the right way now or you will suffer forever.
 <li>But this is supposed to be a quick experiment!
   <p>
  You can perfectly well do a quick experiment by modifying the original code;
  indeed, it should be quicker to do it that way.
</ul>
<p>
Fear not!
Just change the code!
