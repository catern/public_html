      Distributed programs execute pieces of their code in parallel on
      different processors. [...] The first requirement for distributed
      programming support is therefore the ability to assign different parts
      of a program to be run on different processors.

    Software-defined networking (SDN). Note that the SDN term is somewhat abused, and today lots of people use it to mean "overlay networks implemented in software". I mean the original sense:
    <blockquote cite="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos597E/papers/sdnhistory.pdf">
      An SDN consolidates the control plane, so that a single software
      control program controls multiple data-plane elements. The SDN control
      plane exercises direct control over the state in the network’s
      data-plane elements (i.e., routers, switches, and other middleboxes).

    sometimes called
    "<a href="https://dev.to/rajasegar/html-over-the-wire-is-the-future-of-web-development-542c">HTML over the wire</a>".
    I think this is best explained by the docs for
    <a href="https://github.com/pkamenarsky/replica">replica</a>:
    <blockquote cite="https://github.com/pkamenarsky/replica">
      In contrast to traditional virtual DOM implementations, a remote
      virtual DOM runs on the server and is replicated to the client,
      which just acts as a dumb terminal. [...] With a remote VDOM,
      all code runs on the backend – no need to come up with ways to
      share functionality between server and client, to validate forms
      twice or authenticate API requests.
